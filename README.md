# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This project was meant for us to practice third-party API's, such as Dayjs and Jquery. We were advised to use the documentation related to those API's to use what we needed tp get the project done. Our goal was to modify starter code into a usable work day planner, with the current hour being highlighted red, past hours grey, and future hours green. you will also be able to write down plans and save them to the local storage so they will be saved apon reset.

# Usage

type in the textboxes your plans, and then click the blue save icon to the right of whatever line you were on to save it.\
